Abstract: Social media played a crucial role in the revitalization and growth of the Black Lives Matter movement, particularly after the George Floyd incident. The circulation of the video on platforms like Facebook sparked public outrage and demands for justice. Social media facilitated outreach, organization of protests, and the development of support networks. The hashtag #BlackoutTuesday gained traction on Instagram, prompting debates about its impact. Despite criticisms of performative activism, the overall sentiment towards social media's role in the movement is positive. The frequent words and phrases reflect a positive sentiment, although some acknowledge potential harm. Social media's power and influence highlight the need to wield it responsibly for positive change. The viral video and ongoing discussions through hashtags demonstrated a refusal to let authorities dismiss the case, challenging systemic racism.
